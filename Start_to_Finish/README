Steps and scripts needed

Master Notebook - takes in a range of files and runs start-to-finish process on each (in parallel?)
Start-to-finish Notebook - takes in a favites dataset and spits out a plot for each experiment listed above

Things to think about: 
    - data persistence/storage?
    - making new folders/files and where they are being made?
    - how to integrate this with a web app?

Graph
1. Convert FAVITES file format to a graph tool object
    - getting favites file from gitlab
    - separating favites file into nodes and edges without creating new files
    - output: create new folder properly labeled
    - TBD: infection probability, suffix
2. Convert that graph tool object into a weighted graph with infection probability
    - use cascade reconstruction repo file

Cascades
1. Convert FAVITES file format to usable cascades and save to a pickle file
    - output: create new folder properly labeled
    - vary the observed fraction from [0.1, 0.9]

Experiment 1
1. Run root sampler experiments on each pickle file (in parallel)
2. Save AP score to an output file
3. Generate plot of observed fraction vs AP score

Experiment 2
1. Run probabilistic experiment (as reflected by paper lattice experiment)
2. Save plot
